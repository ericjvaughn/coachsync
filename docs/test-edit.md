# Route Library System Test

This is a test file to ensure editing capabilities are working correctly.

## Sample Route Data Structure

```typescript
// Example Route Type
interface Route {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  pathPoints: Point[];
  category: RouteCategory;
  depth: number; // How deep the route goes
}

// Route Categories
enum RouteCategory {
  SHORT = 'short',
  MEDIUM = 'medium',
  DEEP = 'deep',
  SCREEN = 'screen'
}
```

This file is only a test to ensure Cascade can properly edit files in the CoachSync codebase.
