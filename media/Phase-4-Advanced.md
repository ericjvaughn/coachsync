# AI SELF-CONTROL PROTOCOL

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RULES FOR AI (DO NOT IGNORE) ðŸš¨

### Rule 1: ABSOLUTE PRESERVATION
- Phases 1-3 are SACRED and UNTOUCHABLE
- No "improvements" to existing code, even if critical
- No "better ways" to do things, even if obvious
- No "efficiency improvements", even if simple
- If it works, DO NOT TOUCH IT
- No "final cleanup" before shipping
- No "last-minute fixes" to old code
- PRESERVATION > PERFECTION

### Rule 2: STRICT PHASE ADHERENCE
- Build ONLY what is listed in Phase 4
- If a feature isn't listed, DO NOT BUILD IT
- If a task requires modifying Phases 1-3, STOP and ASK
- No "while we're here" additions

### Rule 3: SCOPE CONTROL
- Check "What NOT to Build" before EVERY task
- If you think "it would be nice to also...", STOP
- No adding "useful" features not in spec
- No "preparing" for future phases

### Rule 4: COMMUNICATION REQUIRED
- If stuck, ASK instead of modifying
- If you see a "better way", DISCUSS it first
- If you feel the urge to refactor, STOP and EXPLAIN why
- Never assume it's okay to modify existing code

### Rule 5: INTEGRATE, DON'T INFILTRATE
- Advanced features MUST work with existing code AS IS
- Create parallel systems, not replacements
- Use event listeners and hooks, NEVER modify
- If core changes seem needed, STOP and DISCUSS
- Build bridges, not renovations
- Add layers, don't modify layers
- Create adapters, don't adjust targets
- ADAPTATION > MODIFICATION

### Rule 6: LESS IS MORE
- Every line of code is a liability
- If it "might be useful later", don't write it
- Complexity dies by a thousand "helpful" additions
- No "just in case" code
- No "this might be handy" functions
- No "wrapper for future use"
- SIMPLE > CLEVER
- READABLE > ELEGANT
- MINIMAL > FLEXIBLE

### Rule 7: COMPLETE, DON'T FRAGMENT
- Finish EVERY task in the current scope
- No "I'll come back to this later"
- No partial implementations
- No "skeleton code" to fill in later
- If you start something, FINISH IT
- No moving on until current task is 100% done
- No splitting tasks across multiple sessions
- COMPLETION > PROGRESSION

Remember:
- Half-finished features are technical debt
- Partial implementations create confusion
- Coming back later means never
- Context switching kills productivity

EMBRACE:
âœ“ One task at a time
âœ“ Full implementation
âœ“ Complete documentation
âœ“ Thorough testing

AVOID:
âœ— "We can finish this later"
âœ— "Let's just get the basic structure"
âœ— "I'll add the details next time"
âœ— "This is good enough for now"

Remember:
- Each line of code you write is a line you'll maintain forever
- Each abstraction you add is complexity you'll explain forever
- Each "helpful utility" is a dependency you'll manage forever
- Each "flexible solution" is a decision you'll defend forever

Your job is to solve the problem, not build a framework.
Your goal is working software, not a showcase of patterns.
Your measure is business value, not code elegance.

EMBRACE:
âœ“ Small, focused functions
âœ“ Direct solutions
âœ“ Obvious code
âœ“ Clear names

AVOID:
âœ— "Flexible" abstractions
âœ— "Reusable" utilities
âœ— "Future-proof" patterns
âœ— "Generic" solutions

THE BEST CODE IS THE CODE YOU DIDN'T WRITE

## Documentation Search Guide

### Real-time Docs
- WebSocket: search "supabase realtime documentation"
- Presence: search "supabase presence documentation"
- Collaboration: search "supabase real-time collaboration"
- Version Control: search "supabase database versioning"

### Mobile Support Docs
- Responsive: search "tailwind responsive design documentation"
- Touch Events: search "react touch events documentation"
- PWA: search "vite pwa documentation"
- Offline: search "vite offline support documentation"

### Game Day Docs
- Local Storage: search "zustand persist offline documentation"
- IndexedDB: search "react indexeddb documentation"
- Performance: search "react mobile performance documentation"

### Analytics Docs
- Data Analysis: search "supabase analytics queries documentation"
- Metrics: search "supabase database metrics documentation"
- Reports: search "react pdf generation documentation"

### Integration Docs
- API Routes: search "supabase rest api documentation"
- Webhooks: search "supabase webhooks documentation"
- OAuth: search "supabase oauth documentation"
- Export: search "supabase data export documentation"

### Search Tips
1. Always include "documentation" in search
2. Include "official" for primary sources
3. Add "typescript" for type definitions
4. Add "examples" for implementation patterns
5. Prioritize framework docs over blog posts

## BEFORE EVERY TASK, I MUST:
1. Read these rules again, EVERY SINGLE TIME
2. Check the "What NOT to Build" list, NO EXCEPTIONS
3. Find the EXACT line item in Phase 4 for this task
4. Verify this won't touch ANY code from Phases 1-3
5. If I think "just one small change to Phase X", STOP
6. If I see technical debt in old phases, IGNORE IT
7. If I think "but this would be easier if...", STOP
8. ADAPT TO THE PAST, DON'T CHANGE IT
